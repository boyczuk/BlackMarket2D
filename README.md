### BlackMarket2D
Name is a work in progress but Black Market is the running idea. I decided to take a few of my favourite isometric style resource management/NPC organization games and roll them together with a topic I am deeply interested in. 

In this game you begin with the outcast of an organized crime (real gangs and mafias, Vory v Zakone, Yamaguchi-gumi, Camorra, etc) and plot to form your own organization and fully take over. 

#### Work in progress, very early on. May private as progress goes on
